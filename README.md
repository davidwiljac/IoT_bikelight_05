This project is a smart IoT bikelight.

The Bikelight utilizes an ESP32C3 and LoRa integrated chip HT-CT62.
The HT-CT62 chip is mounted on the ESP32 Dev Backplane, from Heltec. https://heltec.org/project/esp-dev-backplane/

This repository contains the arudino code for the bikelight and the schematic of the bikelight.
